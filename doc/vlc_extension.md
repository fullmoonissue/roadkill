# VLC Extension

## How to

If you want to create an extension for VLC, here are the functions to declare :

* descriptor() : This function allows to discover your VLC extension into the VLC menu about extensions (must return a lua table)
* activate() : This function is called when you select the extension into the VLC menu about extensions
* close() : This function is called when you close a dialog box (if one is created for the extension)
* deactivate() : This function is called when you re-select (unselect) the extension into the VLC menu about extensions
